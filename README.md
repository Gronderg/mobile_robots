Exercise 4: Implementation of model + Basic Control
  - 4.1 omnidirectional mobile robot Go-to-goal → Proportional Control
  - 4.2 omnidirectional mobile robot Trajectory Tracking → Proportional + Feedforward Control
  - 4.3 Unicycle Go-to-goal → Proportional Control for Orientation

Exercise 5: Collision Avoidance with SI model (omnidirectional mobile robot)
  - 5.1 Point obstacle – switching behavior with obstacle avoidance
  - 5.2 non-point obstacle – switching behavior with wall-following
  - 5.3 Point obstacles – QP-based controller

Exercise 6: Control of Unicycle
  - 6.1 Go to goal
  - 6.2 Trajectory Tracking (Position and Posture cases)
  - 6.3 Obstacle Avoidance towards Waypoints
 
 Project:
  - Unicycle robots go to consensus point without collision, demostration: https://youtu.be/PeYUevJT4no
  - Unicycle robots remain formation go to goal and avoid obstacles
  - SI follows moving reference goal and avoid obstacle
